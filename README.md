# BlipTune

## Main Project Goals
1. Create a unique approach to audio exploration which fosters discovery led by the ears 
2. Build an audio environment which is inviting and conducive of experimentation for musicians of all backgrounds and skill types 
3. Design an application which demonstrates the use of emerging technology as a means for music creation and exploration

## Constraints
- No set tunings: People of different backgrounds may use different tunings
- No Forced Repetition: Repetitive acts brew stale ideas and reduce the degree of creativity
- No Interval Palette: This would discourage the exploration of imperfect intervals and beating
