# BlipTune
This project was built as a Senior Capstone project requirement for the Music Technnology major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

### Main Project Goals
- Create a unique approach to audio exploration which fosters discovery led by the ears 
- Build an audio environment which is inviting and conducive of experimentation for musicians of all backgrounds and skill types 
- Design an application which demonstrates the use of emerging technology as a means for music creation and exploration

### Constraints
- No set tunings: People of different backgrounds may use different tunings
- No Forced Repetition: Repetitive acts brew stale ideas and reduce the degree of creativity
- No Interval Palette: This would discourage the exploration of imperfect intervals and beating 

## The Blip Interface

The interface on each spherical "Blip" was designed to maximize creative possibility and discoverability in as few physical buttons as possible.
