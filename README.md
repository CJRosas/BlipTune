# BlipTune
This project was built as a Senior Capstone requirement for the Music Technnology major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

### Main Project Goals
- Create a unique approach to audio exploration which fosters discovery led by the ears 
- Build an audio environment which is inviting and conducive of experimentation for musicians of all backgrounds and skill types 
- Design an application which demonstrates the use of emerging technology as a means for music creation and exploration

### Constraints
- **No set tunings**: People of different backgrounds may use different tunings
- **No Forced Repetition**: Repetitive acts brew stale ideas and reduce the degree of creativity
- **No Interval Palette**: This would discourage the exploration of imperfect intervals and beating 

## The Blip Interface

The interface on each spherical "Blip" was designed to maximize creative possibility and discoverability in as few physical buttons as possible. 
- **Toggle On/Off Button**: This button simply causes the blip to emit/stop emitting audio
- **Slider**: The slider currently interpolates the blip's emitting audio between a sine wave (slider fully left) and a sawtooth wave (slider fully right)
- **"X" button (on back of blip)**: This button deletes the blip it is attached to
